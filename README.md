<h1>Privacy Policy & Support</h1>

<h2>How do we collect and use information?</h2>
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Apps, Site and related services (collectively, the “Services”), to administer your use of the Services (including your account, if you choose to create an account for your use of the Services), and to enable you to enjoy our Services.
<p>
Location Information. In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.
<p>
Mobile Device Information. When you access the Services via a mobile device, we will collect information related to the mobile device such as the serial number or MAC address and the open UDID of the device. We may use this information to improve and personalize our Services for you.
<p>
Advertising & Third Party Products and Services
<p>
The Services are supported via advertising, and we collect certain data to help the Services serve ads. We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Services are being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. We work with advertisers and third party advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in the Services. Advertisers and advertising networks use some of the information collected by the Services, including the unique identification ID of your mobile device. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use an encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties can’t identify you personally. These third parties may also obtain information about other services you’ve downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile websites you visit, your non-precise location information (e.g., your zip code), and other non-precise location information in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Services and elsewhere. We may also share encrypted versions of information you have provided in order to enable our partners to append other available information about you for analysis or advertising related use.
<p>
<h2>What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?</h2>
<p>
We will not share any information that we have collected from you except as described below:

<h4>The Security of Your Information</h4>
We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your information) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.

<h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.
<h4>Modifying Your Information</h4>
You can access and modify the information associated with your account in the “Settings” section of the Services. If you want us to delete your information and your account, please contact us at fun@fungames-forfree.com with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.
<h4>International Transfer</h4>
Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we may transfer your information to the United States and Brazil and process it there.
Our Policy Toward Children
Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
Changes to Privacy Policy
Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of such changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you a notification and we’ll indicate when such changes will become effective.
